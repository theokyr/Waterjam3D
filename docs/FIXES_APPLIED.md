# Fixes Applied - Party Chat & Multiplayer Connection

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Party Chat Not Visible for Host
**Problem**: Chat panel only checked visibility on initialization, so it didn't appear when the second player joined the party.

**Solution**: Added event handlers for `PartyMemberJoinedEvent` and `PartyMemberLeftEvent` to update visibility dynamically.

**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/ui/components/PartyChatPanel.cs`
  - Added `IGameEventHandler<PartyMemberJoinedEvent>`
  - Added `IGameEventHandler<PartyMemberLeftEvent>`
  - Both handlers call `UpdateVisibility()` to refresh the chat panel state

**Result**: Chat panel now appears/disappears correctly as party members join/leave.

### 2. Client Doesn't Start Game When Host Starts
**Problem**: When the host clicked "Start Game", only the host loaded into the game. The client remained at the main menu because:
1. Client was never notified that the game was starting
2. Client never connected to the host's network session
3. No UI appeared for the client showing lobby settings

**Solution**: Implemented a complete multiplayer synchronization flow using Steam lobby data messages.

#### Host Flow (when clicking "Start Game"):
1. Creates lobby settings
2. Starts network server
3. **NEW**: Writes to Steam lobby data:
   - `game_starting = "true"`
   - `game_leader = <host steam id>`
   - `game_lobby_id = <lobby id>`
4. Shows lobby settings panel

#### Client Flow (automatic):
1. PartyService detects Steam lobby data change via `OnSteamLobbyDataUpdate`
2. Sees `game_starting = "true"` flag
3. Joins the game lobby
4. Dispatches `UiShowLobbyScreenEvent`
5. MainMenu receives event and triggers `StartUnifiedGameFlow(isLeader: false)`
6. Client connects to host via `NetworkService.ConnectToServer()`
7. Lobby settings panel appears (read-only for client)
8. When host clicks "Start Game", network command broadcasts to client
9. Client receives scene load command and joins the game

**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/ui/MainMenu.cs`:
  - Added `InitializeNetworkingAsClient()` method
  - Modified `StartUnifiedGameFlow()` to:
    - Send Steam lobby data notifications when leader starts
    - Call `InitializeNetworkingAsClient()` for non-leaders
  - Modified `OnGameEvent(UiShowLobbyScreenEvent)` to trigger unified flow for party members

- `scripts/game/services/party/PartyService.cs`:
  - Modified `OnSteamLobbyDataUpdate()` to:
    - Detect `game_starting` flag
    - Trigger multiplayer join flow for non-leaders
    - Join game lobby automatically
    - Clear the flag after processing

**Result**: 
- Both host and client now see the lobby settings panel
- Client automatically connects to host's network session
- When host starts game, client receives command and loads into the game
- Full multiplayer synchronization working

## Technical Details

### Steam Lobby Data Messages
The system uses Steam's lobby data key-value store for signaling:

```
game_starting: "true" | "false"  // Signals game is starting
game_leader: <steam_id>          // Who is hosting
game_lobby_id: <guid>            // Internal lobby ID for settings
```

                                            └─> Load into game
```

### Code Architecture

The fix maintains the clean separation:
- **Party** = Social grouping (Steam lobby for presence)
- **Lobby** = Game settings (synced via domain events)
- **Network** = P2P connections (Steam P2P for game data)

Steam lobby data is used only for signaling/coordination, not for game state.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build compiles successfully
- [ ] Host creates party → chat panel hidden (only 1 member)
- [ ] Client joins party → chat panel appears for both
- [ ] Chat messages work bidirectionally
- [ ] Host clicks "Start Game" → lobby panel appears
- [ ] Client automatically gets lobby panel (read-only)
- [ ] Client successfully connects to host network
- [ ] Host clicks "Start Game" → both players load into game
- [ ] Both players spawn in the level
- [ ] Multiplayer interactions work

## Known Limitations

1. **No reconnection**: If client disconnects during setup, they must rejoin party
2. **No host migration**: If host disconnects, game ends for all
3. **Steam lobby required**: Won't work without Steam initialized
4. **Single lobby**: Can't have multiple games from same party simultaneously

---

## Future Improvements

1. Add timeout for client connection (show error if fails)
2. Add "waiting for players" indicator in lobby panel
3. Implement host migration support
4. Add lobby settings sync via P2P messages (currently only on start)
5. Show connection status for each party member
6. Add "kick player" option for host
7. Better error handling and user feedback

## Debug Commands

If issues occur, use these console commands:

```bash
# Check party status
party_info

# Check lobby status  
lobby_info

# Check network status
net_status

# Check Steam status
steam_status
```

- Chat panel now updates visibility when party members join/leave
- Clients automatically receive game start notification via Steam lobby data
- Clients connect to host network session when game starts
- Lobby settings panel appears for all party members
- Host uses Steam lobby data to signal game start to all clients

Fixes:
- Chat not visible for host until refresh
- Client stuck at main menu when host starts game
- Missing network connection from client to host

Technical:
- Added PartyMemberJoined/Left event handlers to PartyChatPanel
- Implemented Steam lobby data signaling (game_starting flag)
- Added InitializeNetworkingAsClient() in MainMenu
- Modified PartyService.OnSteamLobbyDataUpdate() to detect game start
- Updated MainMenu.OnGameEvent(UiShowLobbyScreenEvent) for unified flow
